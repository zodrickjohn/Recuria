    "notes": "Ethan's resume demonstrates a strong academic background in aerospace engineering, with a high GPA and relevant coursework.  However, his experience is heavily focused on aerospace and lacks direct full-stack web development experience required for this Software Engineer I role.  His technical skills are impressive, but not directly transferable.  His projects showcase strong problem-solving abilities and technical skills, but do not align with the job description's requirements.  Consider whether his transferable skills (e.g., Git, AWS, problem-solving) are sufficient to warrant further consideration.",
